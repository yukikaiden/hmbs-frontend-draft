Notes (to be done):

#Request Approved Details Page - navigate to this page when the status is approved, otherwise navigate to request details for the status to be changed

#Request Details Instructor - approve button feedback modal (you approved this request etc.)

#CRUD Inventory Page - edit item input fields are different from the input fields in Add New Item Admin page. change input fields in this latter page

#Add New Item Admin - submit item button must show success feedback modal

#CRUDUserPageAdmin - registry modals need to be made

#AdminModal modal icons need to be changed - must be similar in style to high-fi prototype (rounded edges, outline shape)
