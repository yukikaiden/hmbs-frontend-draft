/// #Request Approved Details Page - navigate to this page when the status is approved, otherwise navigate to request details for the status to be changed

/// #Request Details Instructor - approve button feedback modal (you approved this request etc.)

/// #CRUD Inventory Page - edit item input fields are different from the input fields in Add New Item Admin page. change input fields in this latter page

/// #Add New Item Admin - submit item button must show success feedback modal

/// #CRUDUserPageAdmin - registry modals need to be made

/// #AdminModal modal icons need to be changed - must be similar in style to high-fi prototype (rounded edges, outline shape)

#requestdetails all views list of items table add price column
#item create and update details add price
#transactionpage on going borrow req table add price column
#transactionpage export list button disabled until request approved
